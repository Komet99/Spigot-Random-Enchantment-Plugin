# Spigot-Random-Enchantment-Plugin
Gives all players a random enchantment after 10 seconds

Does what it says. Originally created for version 1.16 of minecraft, every 10 seconds it adds a random enchantment to a random item in every players inventory.
The enchantment's level randomly varies between 1 and 32, creating sometimes broken, but mostly useless items.
Items in the player's hotbars and armor slots will also be affected.

Also the first plugin I have ever programmed, hence the name.

Use */start* to start the plugin.
